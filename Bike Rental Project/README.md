# Bike Rental Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my analysis on bike rental data from Newark, New Jersey!

Here I analyze the bike rental data for Newark and its surrounding areas for the year 2016. I also analyze how weather and other factors impact bike ridership throughout the year. Some of these factors include:
- Temperature
- Precipitation
- Wind
- Location
- Holidays

The different files that I have in here include:
- Two Jupyter Notebooks that are used to clean and analyze the original data:
  * One for analyzing Newark's weather throughout 2016
  * One for analyzing the bike trip data and station information throughout 2016
- An Excel spreadsheet with the database schema
- A text file listing the PostGreSQL queries used
- A Word document write-up detailing the data cleaning and analysis process and findings
- PDF files with some background information, including descriptions of the columns used in the original CSV files

That's a brief synopsis of this project. Take some time to dive in and learn more about this analysis. Enjoy!
