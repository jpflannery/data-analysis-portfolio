# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! Here is where I have my data analysis projects for you to see. I will have projects in here covering a variety of subjects, but ultimately a lot will be sports-related, since I love sports. Currently, I have the following projects in here:

- Bike Rentals (Newark, NJ)

I am an accountant by trade, and I even have a CPA license. However, over the last few years, I have also become interested in data analysis/science, and so I have been learning data analysis and data science in Codecademy. I plan to at least supplement my accounting skills with these skills over the next few years, especially since large sets of financial data is becoming an ever-increasing component of accounting.

There are more projects to come. Please check back from time to time for more projects.

Thank you and take care!
